      <description>Today my Amazon feed was filled with the suggestions of mouse jigglers varying from different shape, size and features. It happened when few days back during a conversation with my friend it came as a topic where he want to use something like a mouse jiggler when he is working from home and still want to be shown as active on Microsoft Teams when he is away doing some household chores.</description>

      <description>I was planning to build a web based temperature/humidity monitoring app with Raspberry PI 3 and Windows 10 IoT Core. I have playing around with Raspbian for a while now and this time I wanted to try something different. I have been using Python to write application for Raspberry PI, Windows IoT Core with C# will be something new for me and therefore, this time I choose to go with Windows 10 IoT Core.</description>

      <description>I have been playing a lot with Raspberry PI and Python these days and have also started a side project to create robot car controller with a Xbox 360 wireless controller. I am planning to controller a robot car using a custom interface from my Windows machine. Initially I tried with PyQt but I dropped the idea for now as Python is not my primary expertise and it will take some time for me to learn the basics and get into some serious coding.</description>

      <description>As an enthusiast, I started working with embedded with Netduino. It was fun but at the same time Netduino was not offering that much things that I can do now. For a person like me who has no knowledge of electronics and C/C++, this was a gift. Now here I am using Raspberry PI&amp;rsquo;s latest version and I have everything I ever wanted on a single piece of hardware.
To get started with Python and Raspberry PI, I looked into the &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo; sort of LED blinking example.</description>
