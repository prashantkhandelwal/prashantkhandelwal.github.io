      <description>Today my Amazon feed was filled with the suggestions of mouse jigglers varying from different shape, size and features. It happened when few days back during a conversation with my friend it came as a topic where he want to use something like a mouse jiggler when he is working from home and still want to be shown as active on Microsoft Teams when he is away doing some household chores.</description>

      <description>I was planning to build a web based temperature/humidity monitoring app with Raspberry PI 3 and Windows 10 IoT Core. I have playing around with Raspbian for a while now and this time I wanted to try something different. I have been using Python to write application for Raspberry PI, Windows IoT Core with C# will be something new for me and therefore, this time I choose to go with Windows 10 IoT Core.</description>
