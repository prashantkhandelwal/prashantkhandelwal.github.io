      <description>A Few months back I wrote a post on how to use jQuery plugin Uploadify to upload single/multiple files without postback in ASP.NET. The program works similarly to simple file upload sites in its ease of use. Now a few days back I was working on a demo project which is on MVC 3 Razor and I use the same plugin without any problems. But the files that are being uploaded are uploaded to the root folder instead of the folder I specified to upload the files.</description>
