      <description>Everyone loves fast search results.
In 2017 (if I am remembering it correctly), at Microsoft Build event, Microsoft announces Bot framework and did a demo with CosmosDB graph database which uses Gremlin query from Apache TinkerPop. It was a great demo and I was really impressed how they did it but unfortunately I was unable to find the source code for that demo anywhere. So I thought I should atleast get the graph database for my own use and then sometime later will work on building a NLU bot.</description>
