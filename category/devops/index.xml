      <description>Terraform is my go-to IAC tool for building my infrastructure in Azure. I usually use Azure DevOps pipeline to execute my terraform plan, but it would be nice to know if I can execute it programmatically or on request basis. Even on request basis you can trigger a CI/CD pipeline to provision the infrastructure but maybe it is too much for a simple project to have.
One of the biggest pain points has been the authentication in command line tooling.</description>
