      <description>In the past decade Marvel has gathered a lot of fans following which eventually led all the fans to know more about how the Marvel comics universe characters, stories, events are mapped or linked to each other.
In 2017 (if I am remembering it correctly), at Microsoft Build event, Microsoft announces Bot framework and did a demo with CosmosDB graph database which uses Gremlin query from Apache TinkerPop. It was a great demo, and I was really impressed by how they did it but unfortunately, I was unable to find the source code for that demo anywhere.</description>
