      <description>I was checking out the OpenObserve — an open-source observability tool which you can self-host or use their cloud offering which offers free, standard and enterprise tier to choose from.
Written completely in rust so I thought of checking the codebase on Github to get myself more aquatinted with rust language. While doing so I found a #[cfg(feature = &amp;quot;enterprise&amp;quot;)] being used in many places.
Looking at it, one can tell that any function or block decorated with this attribute is conditional, available only if the feature is enabled.</description>
