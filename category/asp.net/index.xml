      <description>Visual Studio has made integrating of Azure Active Directory authentication in web applications very simple. If you are creating the application and want to integrate the AD authentication then it is a pretty easy task given that you have an Active Directory in Azure. But what if you have an application and it is out there running and now you want to change the authentication medium of your application so you can have better control and security of your web application.</description>

      <description>Ever since the .NET stack went open source last year, there is a huge excitement among the developers about the .NET stuff and developing apps using .NET which are no longer limited to Windows platform. I tried to install ASP.NET VNext on Ubuntu VM in which I terribly failed in the first go. Why? because the tutorial I used was quite old and I messed up the installation of pre-requisites.</description>

      <description>This is open-source at its best. Running background task to work in context with ASP.NET was and is still a big deal for few developers. I user QueueUserWorkItem to schedule emails when a new comment is added on my blog. This makes sure that the UI is responsive and the user can close or navigate to other post. I have been working on enterprise applications for many years now and most of the long running tasks are running in the background i.</description>

      <description>There are many syntax highlighting plugins available on the web right now. Majority of the sites are using javascript based Syntax Highlighter from Alex Gorbatchev. I am using it for my current blog and BlogEngine.NET has it as a default syntax highlighter. It is good because it has a lot of themes to offer and you can also customize according to the look and feel of your blog or site.</description>

      <description>When I heard about Glimpse, I thought it like to be another MiniProfiler like stuff or a combination of MiniProfiler and this. But it seems to be more robust diagnostic tool for developers. Here is my experience with this awesome diagnostic tool.
What is Glimpse? Glimpse is a diagnostic tool for ASP.NET applications which let you see detailed diagnostic information of your web application. Glimpse knows everything your server is doing and displays it straight away to you in your browser.</description>

      <description>I was exploring Github for some image effects/filters and I found some but still keep exploring and found an interesting plugin called face-detection. This plugin uses HTML5 getUserMedia to use your web camera only if your browser supports it. Unfortunately, IE10 still doesn’t support it. This seems cool to me, so I created a sample application to test it. This sample application will let you preview the video using your web camera and allows you to capture the image from your web camera and upload it to the Azure storage.</description>

I do have a dump, but I was more curious to know about the application that they built to query the database. And I must admit that I learned tons of things.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, while working on a project I came across a weird problem while working with Colorbox jquery plugin and ASP.NET. The problem is not only with Colorbox but also with another famous plugin called Fancybox. If you plan to use the plugine just to show dialog boxes, then this plugin works perfectly fine. Integrating the plugin with ASP.NET works fine but prevents post back if you have server controls on the colorbox dialog box (which is actually an invisible div on the page).</description>

Few days back as usual I was chasing Windows Live SDK updates on Twitter and yes the most awaited SkyDrive API was made available to all the developers. I will be writing a post later on how to upload files using SkyDrive API.
Setting up the application To integrate Windows Live Sign-In support I have downloaded the LiveService samples from Github and take a look at ASP.</description>

      <description>I didn&amp;rsquo;t create the whole solution by myself. The initial idea is from the All-In-One Code Framework sample. I was just customizing my BlogEngine and for one of the module I thought it would be nice not to use paging and I should go for infinite scrolling stuff. This idea seems cool to me and without wasting any time I just do a quick web search and I came across a solution which is a part of a All-In-One Code Framework.</description>

      <description>No one likes if their favourite site is loading up slow. Using CSS sprites instead of using individual images and minify javascript and css files is a way to minimize the request send to the server and also saves you few KBs or may be even MBs. If your site is high on using javacript and CSS then you should minimize them.
I recently used SquishIt to combine/minimize my CSS and javascript files.</description>

A friend of mine is trying to integrate multiple third party authentication support for one of the application he is developing for his client. He is using DotNetOpenAuth for Google authentication. the code I am using here is from my friend and I am sharing it with his explicit permission.</description>

      <description>I came across an article on Tutorialzine which demonstrate file drag and drop upload with jQuery and PHP. As a curious reader, I downloaded the sample files and took a look and also get it running on my LINUX VM. It worked like a charm. But I am a Windows user and .NET programmer, the question is how can I do the same in ASP.NET?
So, to get myself started I used the same downloaded files that I used to check the PHP version of the file drag and drop.</description>

      <description>Previously in a lot of hurry I wrote a post on how to upload files in MVC3 with the help of Uploadify, a famous jQuery plugin to upload files. If you have not heard about it yet, then it is time for you to check and find out what this plugin can do for you. Appending my last post about this plugin (which was not very well written) I tried one more thing with it today.</description>

      <description>Appending my previous post, I have created a plugin in JQuery to get twitter followers count, facebook likes and feed readers count. In my previous post, I have shown a way to get the counts in ASP.NET and I have created this plugin so that everyone can use and show counts on their blogs or site.
To get started add the two javascript files, one is the jquery file and the other one is the plugin file.</description>

The program works similarly to simple file upload sites in its ease of use. Now a few days back I was working on a demo project which is on MVC 3 Razor and I use the same plugin without any problems. But the files that are being uploaded are uploaded to the root folder instead of the folder I specified to upload the files.</description>

      <description>To locate a place on maps (Bing or Google), the best thing is to get the latitude and longitude of the location, this ensures that the place we are pinning on the map is accurate. But the big question is to where to get the latitude and longitude of the location. There might be a web service for getting the latitude and longitude of a location, but wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be nice if you just have to query a local database?</description>

But some notorious users create short URLs for the spam sites which doesn&amp;rsquo;t make any sense to us. As you know by looking at the short URLs, they won&amp;rsquo;t reveal anything.

You can set the height and width of the CAPTCHA image while initializing the CAPTCHA class. The CAPTCHA image generated from the class can be set to the image control directly or it can be save to the local path and then set to the image control.</description>

      <description>Building auto-complete feature with jQuery is easy and you can build this in no time. It&amp;rsquo;s your wish if you want to use ADO.NET or EF (LINQ) to get this done, it works great for all. The sample application I build is using both ADO.NET and EF. So let&amp;rsquo;s begin up getting files under one hood.
Use the below live links for jQuery auto-complete and CSS.
&amp;lt;link rel=&#34;stylesheet&#34; href=&#34;http://dev.jquery.com/view/trunk/plugins/autocomplete/jquery.autocomplete.css&#34; type=&#34;text/css&#34; /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;script type=&#34;</description>

      <description>Last month I have blogged on how you can integrate OpenID login support in your ASP.NET aplication. Some of the reader requested me that it would be better if I could show how you can implement membership and roles with OpenID authentication. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t seems easy in the first place, because you will require a bit more informaton from the user like his name and e-mail address. So, what I am trying to show you here is how you can gather information of the user who has logged in with OpenID and then you can use that information to set roles and membership for your website.</description>

But now we have an excellent open source plugin called Uploadify.</description>

For folks who are new to OpenID I am going to demonstrate how you can implement one in your project with ease.</description>

      <description>URL Routing was first introduced in .NET framework 3.5 SP1 but MVC has built-in and works pretty decently to create SEO friendly URL and prevents URL hacking. ASP.NET 4.0 is now introduced with a new feature called URL routing with web forms. URL routing help developers to create short and friendly URLs which enhance search engine page ranking. There are few other ways to create short friendly URLs like URLrewriter.net extension or if you have a physical access to IIS you can have installed URL Rewriter extension for IIS 7 to create short friendly URLs.</description>

      <description>Jquery is now one of the most favorite JavaScript frameworks to play around. It offers some more advance feature to the developers and UI designers to accomplish their task easily and more conveniently. Take an example of AJAX and think where you can face the problems when you have to deal with different browsers who support XMLHTTP request and the one who don’t. I remember, I use to initialize the AJAX’s XMLHTTP object keeping in mind what will be my client’s browser.</description>
