      <description>My team at Microsoft is responsible for building tools that enhance customer experience when you contact Microsoft support. Although our tools are never used by customers directly but they play an essential role in improving the experience and overall cost reductions. This means that our work is critical for the overall success and it should perform under variance of load, especially on holidays.
Problem Statement Team wants to test their application from different geographies and mark the metrics used.</description>
