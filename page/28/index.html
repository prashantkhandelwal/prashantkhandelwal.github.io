    <p>As a programmer, you put a lot of effort to create an application and incorporate some unique features in your application, which in turn makes your application more feature rich and different from other applications. The question here is, how do you feel when you come to know that someone has played with your code and then make a same application with his name&hellip;You did all the hard work and some random guy on this blue planet stole your code and takes all the credit.</p>

<p>Well the answer lies in Obfuscation. It is a method to prevent your application from being reverse engineered. It makes the code of your application in unreadable form when it is viewed in any reflection tool. You will find many obfuscator tool, but some of them are not free and others are not ease at use. I do some search over the net and found a totally free and reliable tool for obfuscating my applications and libraries. This free obfuscating tool can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.foss.kharkov.ua/g1/projects/eazfuscator/dotnet/Default.aspx">here</a>. The version here supports obfuscations for .NET framework 3.5 and for .NET framework 4.0, well we have to wait for the final release as it is still in beta but can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.foss.kharkov.ua/g1/projects/eazfuscator/dotnet/BetaPreview.aspx">here</a>.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see <a href="http://www.red-gate.com/products/reflector/">Red Gate&rsquo;s Reflector</a> and Eazfuscator.NET (actual name of the obfuscater tool) in action</p>

<p>First I created a basic simple greeting application in Visual Studio 2008 (.NET Framework 3.5). The application has two buttons which greets the user and world respectively. Now take a look how the binary is diassembled by using reflector.</p>

<p><img src="/images/reflector.png" alt=".NET Reflector" /></p>

<p>And now we will use Eazfuscator.NET to obfuscate our application. So first download and install the obfuscator tool form the above link and then simple drag-n-drop application on the right segment. I remommend to read the whole documentation before you start obfuscating your application and assemblies and make sure you have a bacup of your original application before you proceed.</p>

<p>Drag and drop your application here.</p>

<p><img src="/images/eazfuscator-app.png" alt="Eazfuscator app" /></p>

<p>As soon as you drop your binary here the obfuscation process will start automatically.</p>

<p><img src="/images/eazfuscator-done.png" alt="Eazfuscator app in action" /></p>

<p>And thats it, your code is now safe and you can distribute you applicaion without any more worries.</p>

<p>Now try opening your obfuscated application in reflector&hellip;.and this is what you will see.</p>

    <p>Working with hash tables is pretty simple but few days back I was having a problem in retrieving a key from a value in hash table. I was bit lazy to find a way myself, so I searched the net and here is what I got&hellip;.a simple piece of code which lead to me to complete my task and so I thought I should share it with everyone here.</p>

<p><pre class="brush:csharp">
public string FindKey(string Value, Hashtable HT)
{
       string Key = &ldquo;&rdquo;;
       IDictionaryEnumerator e = HT.GetEnumerator();
       while (e.MoveNext())
       {
            if (e.Value.ToString().Equals(Value))
            {
               Key = e.Key.ToString();
            }
       }
       return Key;

    <p>This SQL stored procedure will allow you to write to the file on your file system. Note the file system will be the the same on which the SQL server is running. If you are using this with your local SQL server then it will write and create files on your local file system and if you are on the remote machine, the file system will be the remote file system.</p>

<pre class="brush:sql">
Create Procedure  [dbo].[USP_SaveFile](@text as NVarchar(Max),@Filename Varchar(200)) 
AS
Begin
  
declare @Object int,
        @rc int, -- the return code from sp_OA procedures

End
 
Exec @rc = master.dbo.sp_OADestroy @Object 
     
End
</pre>

<p>But before you start using this procedure you need to reconfigure some advanced SQL server settings. Use the below configuration query to enable &lsquo;OLE Automation Procedures&rsquo;. If this is not enabled and you try executing the procedure you will get errors.</p>

<pre class="brush:sql">
Use master
GO
-- To allow advanced options to be changed.
EXEC sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1
GO
--To enable Ole automation feature
EXEC sp_configure 'Ole Automation Procedures', 1;
GO
RECONFIGURE;
GO
</pre>

<p>The first parameter will take the text to be written to the file and the second parameter will take the complete path of the file to be created with the text in it. You can also use the same procedure to wite binary files to the file system, you just need to check and change the file extension in the second parameter. Usage:</p>

    <p>What you do to export data from SQL to excel. You use data import/export wizard or just simply execute the select query and copy the whole lot of data in an excel file with headers. Copy and paste the data in the excel sheet is the quickest possible solution I can see&hellip;but what if you have to data through your code? Still there are many possible ways to accomplish this but how many lines of code you have to write to achieve this? maybe most of the people definately have a simple and reliable way. Ok&hellip;lets do this using T-SQL query. The only problem I see here is that you must have a excel file in the location defined in the query before you execute the query.</p>

<p>In one of our application we maintain log in a sql table for all the tasks done in the whole day. The administrator of the application want to take a look at all the tasks done by a particular user, he didn&rsquo;t want any UI to look into this instead he asks us to generate a report at the end of the day in excel on a button click. So lets see the code.</p>

<p>Execute the below query to set the configuration of SQL Server to 1. In my case there was no change as I already executed this query in the past. But, most probably you will see a change in the your case the value could be changed from 0 to 1.</p>

<pre class="brush:sql">
EXEC sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1;
GO RECONFIGURE;
GO EXEC sp_configure 'Ad Hoc Distributed Queries', 1;
GO RECONFIGURE;
GO
</pre>

<p>After you set the configuration option execute a normal select query to get all the column names and paste them in the excel sheet. Then save the excel sheet in your local hard drive.</p>

<pre class="brush:sql">
Select TOP 0 * From Person.Address
 
--For Office 2003 (.XLS) format

    <p>Performance of an application matters a lot for a developer. None of the developer wants his application freezes or crashes. But what are measures a developer should takes to keep it all good going. When I used to develop application I saw whenever I try to perform some heavy or bulky task like uploading files, copying files from place to other and other DB related but heavy task which includes CPU as well as hard drive.</p>

<p>Most of our application that we develop today require simultaneous functions to perform but with performance. We guarantee our client…yes the application can handle all the functions but on the stake of performance. The major fallback of any application is limiting a user to perform one task at a time. So how do we deal with application freezing and crashing?</p>

<p>Working with Microsoft .NET framework we have worked with threads through which we can handle all the tasks simultaneously under one main application thread. You can perform smaller operations with the help of Threading class, instead I prefer using Background Worker class to implement to perform all my heavy duty operations.
Background worker class is introduced in .NET framework 2.0 and using this class makes it easy to execute long running operations on a separate thread, support cancellation, progress reporting and marshalling results back to the UI thread.</p>

<p>Below image which provides an overview of background worker class which found <a href="http://www.danielmoth.com/">here</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/background-worker-class.png" alt="BackgroundWorker class diagram" /></p>

<p>Now we will see how to use background worker class to perform heavy operations.</p>

<p>First create a new windows application as shown below.</p>

<p><img src="/images/bgw-win-app.jpg" alt="BackgroundWorker windows form app" /></p>

<p>Get to the design mode and drag &amp; drop the background worker component.</p>

<p><img src="/images/bgw-control.jpg" alt="BackgroundWorker control" /></p>

<p>Set the properties of the background worker:</p>

<p>Set <code>GenerateMember</code> and <code>Modifiers</code> as it is. In the sample application we have a progress bar which reports the percentage of the task completed so we need to set the <code>WorkerReportsProgress</code> to <code>true</code> and similarly if we want the user to cancel the running operation then set the <code>WorkerSupportsCancellation</code> to <code>true</code>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/bgw-properties.jpg" alt="BackgroundWorker properties" /></p>

<p>Now the next step is to create 3 methods:</p>

<ol>
<li>DoWork: This is the main method which is responsible to handle the large operation. The code here is not different than the usual code.</li>
<li>ProgressChanged: This method reports the change in the progress of the operation performed by the background worker DoWork method.</li>
<li>RunWorkerCompleted: This method checks the RunWorkerCompletedEventArgs and perform action accordingly.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/images/bgw-events.jpg" alt="BackgroundWorker events" /></p>

<p>So how do we code these methods? It’s easy and not a complex task as it sounds, so let’s have a look at these methods….</p>

<p>To carry on with this example, I am using an AventureWorks database I have query the table Person.Contact as it has a large number of records, around 19K. Now here, to set the progress bar you first need to set the maximum property of the progress bar so we can show the progress completed.</p>

<p>Starting with the Start button:</p>

<pre class="brush:csharp">
private void btn_start_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
//Starts the backgroundworker process asynchronously
bgw.RunWorkerAsync(); 
btn_start.Enabled = false;
}
</pre>

<p>The DoWork method:</p>

<pre class="brush:csharp">
//Background worker DoWork method. Here we will perform our heavy duty tasks.
//I have used a simple datareader object to traverse all the rows in the table. 
//The table has around 19K rows.
private void bgw_DoWork(object sender, DoWorkEventArgs e)
{
  try
  {
    int i = 0;
    cmd = new SqlCommand("SELECT * FROM Person.Contact", con);
    con.Open();
    dr = cmd.ExecuteReader();
    while(dr.Read())
    {
        i = i + 1;
        //report to the backgroungworker progreechanged event of the background worker class
        bgw.ReportProgress(i);
        Thread.Sleep(1);
        //Called and check if the cancellation of the operation is pending. If returned true
        //DoWorkEventArgs object cancels the operation.
        if (bgw.CancellationPending)
        {
            e.Cancel = true;
            return;
        }
    }
   }
   catch (Exception x)
   {
    MessageBox.Show("An error occured while performing operation" + x);
   }
   finally
   {
    con.Close();
   }
}
</pre>

<p>The RunWorkerCompleted Method:</p>

<pre class="brush:csharp">
private void bgw_RunWorkerCompleted(object sender,RunWorkerCompletedEventArgs e)
{
    if (e.Cancelled)
    {
        MessageBox.Show("Operation Cancelled");
        btn_start.Enabled = true;
    }
    else
    {
        MessageBox.Show("Operation Completed");
        btn_start.Enabled = true;
    }
}
</pre>

<p>The ProgressChanged Method:</p>

<pre class="brush:csharp">
private void bgw_ProgressChanged(object sender, ProgressChangedEventArgs e)
{
    //Report porogress bar change
    progress.Value = e.ProgressPercentage;
}
</pre>

<p>Ending up with the cancel button:</p>

<pre class="brush:csharp">
//To cancel async operation
private void btn_cancel_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
     //To cancel the asynchronous operation
     bgw.CancelAsync();
     progress.Value = 0;
     btn_start.Enabled = true;
}
</pre>

<p>So when your application is traversing the records and suddenly you think that you should quit the job and work on other part of the application, just hit the cancel button and the large operation will get cancelled withoud any freezing and hanging of your application.</p>
