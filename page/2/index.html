<p>Visual Studio has made integrating of Azure Active Directory authentication in web applications very simple. If you are creating the application and want to integrate the AD authentication then it is a pretty easy task given that you have an Active Directory in Azure. But what if you have an application and it is out there running and now you want to change the authentication medium of your application so you can have better control and security of your web application. I already have an application and I want to integrate Azure AD authentication, hence I will not be able to change the authentication just like that. I have to manually make the changes to do so. So here it is what I have done to integrate Azure Active Directory in my ASP.NET Core web application.</p>

<h5 id="step-1-create-azure-active-directory">Step 1: Create Azure Active Directory</h5>

<p>When provisioning a new Azure Active Directory you have to go to the old <a href="manage.windowsazure.com">portal manage.windowsazure.com</a>. At the time of writing this blog post, the product team is still in a process of migrating the complete AD feature sets from the old portal to the new portal. Therefore, to create a new AD in Azure, click the <code>Active Directory</code> in the left pane and you will be able to see all the active directories. In the below screen shot you can see that I am a part of Microsoft Active Directory as a <code>User</code>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/active-directory.png" alt="Active Directory" /></p>

<p>If you are planning to use any of the current Active Directory out of the one listed, you can click on it and register your application and users. Note that you have to be a <code>Global Administrator</code> to do that. If you want to create a new Active Directory, then click the <code>NEW</code> button at the bottom left corner to create a new Active Directory.</p>

<p><img src="/images/create-new-ad.png" alt="Create new AD" /></p>

<p>Click on <code>CUSTOM CREATE</code> and a new dialog box will appear in front of you to enter the name of your Active Directory.</p>

<p><img src="/images/add-ad.png" alt="Add AD" /></p>

<p>The green check box in the <code>DOMAIN NAME</code> denotes that the name you have chosen for your active directory is available. When done click the tick button or icon at the bottom right corner of the dialog box to create a new active directory.</p>

<p><img src="/images/new-ad.png" alt="New AD" /></p>

<h5 id="step-2-add-a-user">Step 2: Add a user</h5>

<p>After the creation of active directory is successfully completed, you can see the new created active directory in the list. Notice the <code>ROLE</code> as <code>Global Administrator</code>. Click on the active directory name to view the details. First, I am going to add a new user to the directory. When inside the active directory, click the <code>USERS</code> which in the top of the page.</p>

<p><img src="/images/add-user-ad.png" alt="Add new user in AD" /></p>

<p>I can see a default user added to my new created active directory here which is my official Microsoft user. I cannot delete this user neither I can change much of the roles and other information of this user because it something which is being managed by Microsoft. So to add a new user, click the <code>ADD USER</code> button at the bottom of the page. This will open up a dialog box which allows you to add or create a new user to the active directory. In my case I am going to add a normal user not an administrator, I will keep the the default prompts. The whole process of adding a new user will take 3 steps to complete.</p>

<p><img src="/images/about-user-info.png" alt="User Type in AD" /></p>

<p>In the next screen enter the details about the user. I want to add this user as a normal user hence I am selecting <code>User</code> as a <code>ROLE</code>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/user-profile.png" alt="User Profile in AD" /></p>

<p>In the last step, click the <code>create</code> button to add a new user and generate a temporary password for the new user.</p>

<p><img src="/images/get-temp-password.png" alt="Get temporary password for user" /></p>

<p>Make a note of this password somewhere as you will need it to log in to the account. After the first login, user is prompt to change the password.</p>

<h5 id="step-3-add-an-application-to-the-active-directory">Step 3: Add an application to the Active Directory</h5>

<p>To add a new application, click on the <code>APPLICATION</code> link. Click the <code>ADD</code> button at the bottom of the page to add a new application and then click <code>Add an application my organization is developing</code>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/add-app-ad.png" alt="Add application in AD" /></p>

<p>In the next step enter the name of the application and select the type of application you are building. In my case, it is a web application.</p>

<p><img src="/images/about-app-ad.png" alt="About application" /></p>

<p>In the next step, you add a sign-in URL and app ID URI. The app ID URI I have added is in this format: <code>http://&lt;directoryname&gt;.onmicrosoft.com/adauth</code>. Replace the <code>directoryname</code> with your <code>directory</code> name. The <code>adauth</code> is the name of my application.</p>

<p><img src="/images/add-app-properties.png" alt="Add application properties" /></p>

<p>Once the adding of application is successful, click the <code>USERS</code> link. I can see the new user I have created in the user lists but it is not being assigned to the application yet. To do that, click the <code>ASSIGN</code> button at the bottom of the page and click <code>YES</code>. The <code>ASSIGNED</code> status will be changed from <code>No</code> to <code>Yes</code>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/ad-user-assignment.png" alt="User assignment" /></p>

<h5 id="step-4-setting-up-the-web-application">Step 4: Setting up the web application</h5>

<p>The easy way to set the application up for AD authentication is to create a new &ldquo;demo&rdquo; application and select <code>Change Authentication</code> from the new project dialog box. Select <code>Work or School Accounts</code> and enter the domain name. This will create a new application with all the things set up for your domain. The reason I said &ldquo;demo&rdquo; application because I want to just get the changes that Visual Studio does it for me when I select the AD authentication. This application will now act like a sample application from where I can take the implementation and add it to my existing application.</p>

<p><img src="/images/vs-app-auth-dialog.png" alt="Change auth in Visual Studio" /></p>

<p>Here are the changes I have made to my existing application. As of now my existing application does not have user authentication and now as I want to implement, I will add the account controller and two views which will handle the authentication. In my case this is the account controller, you can name the controller as per your choice. Add two new views in the <code>Views</code> directory for your controller. Call them <code>AccessDenied.cshtml</code> and <code>SignedOut.cshtml</code> respectively.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note that all the changes I am making to my existing application are exactly the same as the sample application.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Code for <code>AccessDenied.cshtml</code> view.</p>

<pre class="brush: csharp">
@{
   ViewData["Title"] = "Access Denied";
}

&lt;header&gt;
    &lt;h1 class="text-danger"&gt;Access Denied.&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p class="text-danger"&gt;You do not have access to this resource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;
</pre>

<p>Code for <code>SignedOut.cshtml</code> view.</p>

<pre class="brush: csharp">
@{
   ViewData["Title"] = "Sign Out";
}
&lt;h2&gt;@ViewData["Title"].&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="text-success"&gt;You have successfully signed out.&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>

<p>Add below NuGet packages for AD authentication support in the application.</p>

<pre class="brush: plain">
Install-Package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication
Install-Package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies
Install-Package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect
</pre>

<p>In the .NET Core project, you will also see a new file called <code>appsettings.json</code>. Add the below configuration to it. Your configuration will than mine.</p>

<pre class="brush: plain">
"Authentication": {
  "AzureAd": {
    "ClientId": "0d9h56ba-ccfd-42f2-9a75-64d8e96756e6",
    "AadInstance": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/",
    "CallbackPath": "/signin-oidc",
    "Domain": "dominicdomain.onmicrosoft.com",
    "TenantId": "d58e5363-f09c-4d65-9808-cd88396529f0"
  }
}
</pre>

<p>In the <code>Startup.cs</code> file, configure the request pipeline by adding the below code in the <code>Configure</code> method. I have added this code just after the <code>UseStaticFiles()</code> functions. This enables the application to use the cookie authentication and OpenId authentication.</p>

<pre class="brush: csharp">
app.UseCookieAuthentication();
 
app.UseOpenIdConnectAuthentication(new OpenIdConnectOptions
{
    ClientId = Configuration["Authentication:AzureAd:ClientId"],
    Authority = Configuration["Authentication:AzureAd:AADInstance"] + Configuration["Authentication:AzureAd:TenantId"],
    CallbackPath = Configuration["Authentication:AzureAd:CallbackPath"]
});
</pre>

<p>In the <code>ConfigureServices</code> method, add the below code.</p>

<pre class="brush: csharp">
services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt; options.SignInScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme);
</pre>

<p>In the <code>AccountController.cs</code>, add the below code.</p>

<pre class="brush: csharp">
[HttpGet]
public IActionResult SignIn()
{
    return Challenge(
        new AuthenticationProperties { RedirectUri = "/" }, OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme);
}

[HttpGet]
public IActionResult SignOut()
{
    var callbackUrl = Url.Action(nameof(SignedOut), "Account", values: null, protocol: Request.Scheme);
    return SignOut(new AuthenticationProperties { RedirectUri = callbackUrl },
        CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme, OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme);
}

[HttpGet]
public IActionResult SignedOut()
{
    if (HttpContext.User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
    {
        return RedirectToAction(nameof(HomeController.Index), "Home");
    }

    return View();
}

[HttpGet]
public IActionResult AccessDenied()
{
    return View();
}
</pre>

<p>Add a new partial view in the <code>Shared</code> folder and name it <code>_LoginPartial.cshtml</code> just like we have in new default scaffold project.</p>

<pre class="brush: csharp">
@using System.Security.Principal
@using System.Security.Claims

@if (User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
{
    var claims = ((ClaimsIdentity)User.Identity).Claims;
    var username = claims.FirstOrDefault(c =&gt; c.Type == "name")?.Value;

    //Uncomment the below code to see the complete email address of the user.
    @*&lt;li class="navbar-text"&gt;Hello @User.Identity.Name!&lt;/li&gt;*@
    &lt;ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"&gt;
        &lt;li class="navbar-text"&gt;Hello @username!&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a asp-area="" asp-controller="Account" asp-action="SignOut"&gt;Sign Out&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
}
else
{
    &lt;ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a asp-area="" asp-controller="Account" asp-action="Signin"&gt;Sign in&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
}
</pre>

<p>Open <code>_Layout.cshtml</code> page, add the below line of code to render this partial view so users can sign in and sign out.</p>

<pre class="brush: csharp">
@await Html.PartialAsync("_LoginPartial")
</pre>

<p>And we are done! This is a minimalistic implementation that you can get start with. Azure Active Directory also provides groups and roles which you need to work with if you are working with the enterprise scale application where security is a major concern. You also have to tweak the code for that. Let&rsquo;s try executing the application and see what happens when I try to authenticate the user for the first time.</p>

<p>When you land on the home page you can see the <code>Sign in</code> link at the top right of the web page.</p>

<p><img src="/images/app-bar.png" alt="App bar" /></p>

<p>When you click on the sign in link, you will be redirected to the <code>login.microsoftonline.com</code> where you will be prompted for the user name and password. After the first successful login, you will be prompted to change the current password.</p>

<p><img src="/images/ad-login-page.png" alt="App AD auth page" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/app-password-change.png" alt="App AD password update page" /></p>

<p>After the successful change of the password, you will be re-directed to the application with your user name as displayed at the top right corner.</p>

<p>I was planning to build a web based temperature/humidity monitoring app with Raspberry PI 3 and Windows 10 IoT Core. I have playing around with Raspbian for a while now and this time I wanted to try something different. I have been using Python to write application for Raspberry PI, Windows IoT Core with C# will be something new for me and therefore, this time I choose to go with Windows 10 IoT Core.</p>

<p><img src="/images/iot-arch-diag.png" alt="IoT Architecture Diagram" /></p>

<p>Here is the list of things to get started:</p>

<ul>
<li>Raspberry PI 3 with Windows 10 IoT Core</li>
<li>Adafruit BME280 Temperature Humidity Pressure sensor<br /></li>
<li>Jumper wires</li>
<li>Power Bank</li>
<li>Visual Studio <sup>2015</sup>&frasl;<sub>2017</sub></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot/docs/iotdashboard">IoT Dashboard</a></li>
<li>Azure account</li>
</ul>

<p>Setting up the PI with Windows 10 IoT Core is a very straight forward process. You can read about it more <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot/docs/iotdashboard">here</a>. I recommend to connect the device to your Wi-Fi network. This will give you a benefit to move your device around. The problem for the first time users will be that the device will not auto-connect to the Wi-Fi network. To solve this problem, you need to use a wired LAN connection from the network or from the local computer. Once plugged in you will be able to see the device in the IoT dashboard from where you can go to <code>Device Portal</code> and connect to the Wi-Fi network. After the connection is successful, you can then remove the LAN cable. To follow the exact steps, head over to this <a href="http://www.opentechguides.com/how-to/article/windows-iot/111/windows-iot-wifi.html">documentation</a>. This is how your device will get displayed in the IoT dashboard.</p>

<p><img src="/images/iot-dashboard.png" alt="IoT Dashboard" /></p>

<h3 id="getting-things-ready-in-azure">Getting things ready in Azure</h3>

<p>You can set up things in the cloud from the Azure Portal as well as from the IoT Dashboard itself. From dashboard you can create and provisioned a new IoT Hub and register the device in that Hub. Here is how you can do that. First sign-in to your Azure account by clicking the Sign-In option in the left hand side bar. After the sign-in is successful, you will be prompted with the below screen where you can provision a new IoT Hub and add your current device in the hub.</p>

<p><img src="/images/iot-provisioning-device.png" alt="IoT Dashboard" /></p>

<p>I am skipping the step for setting the IoT Hub from the Azure Portal as there is a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-create-through-portal">good documentation</a> available at Azure Docs. Pushing data to the IoT Hub with the SDK is easy but you can&rsquo;t make use of the IoT Hub alone to read that data and do your work. Therefore, you also need to set up a Queue to read that data. As of now, you cannot create a Queue from the new Azure Portal instead you have to head towards the old portal at manage.windowsazure.com and create a queue from there. To create a queue, click the <code>New&gt;App Services&gt;Service Bus&gt;Queue&gt;Quick Create</code>. Fill in the details to create a new queue.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Make sure that the region you are selecting here for the queue, it should be the same as your IoT Hub region. If you select a different region than that of your IoT Hub, you will not be able to associate this queue with the hub endpoint.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the Azure Portal, to associate this queue with the IoT Hub endpoint, click the <code>Endpoints</code> and then click <code>Add</code> to add the queue to the endpoint.</p>

<p><img src="/images/create-service-bus.png" alt="Create Service Bus" /></p>

<h4 id="setting-up-the-circuit">Setting up the circuit</h4>

<p>Now as you have the device and the OS ready, you can now build the circuit. The BME280 sensor can be used with both I2C and SPI. For the project, I am using I2C. Below is the Fritzing diagram for your reference. You can download the <a href="https://github.com/prashantkhandelwal/Pi-Code/raw/master/BME280-PI3-Win10IoT-Azure/BME280.fzz">Fritzing sketch file on Github repo</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/iot-fritz-sketch.png" alt="IoT Fritzing Sketch" /></p>

<h4 id="creating-device-application">Creating Device Application</h4>

<p>I am using Visual Studio 2017 Enterprise Edition to build the device application and the web monitor application which I will be hosting in the cloud. For creating the device application, start with selection the Windows Universal project templates and then select <code>Blank App (Universal)</code> template.</p>

<p><img src="/images/vs-universal-app.png" alt="VS Universal app" /></p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is a project template available for Visual Studio which will let you build applications for Raspberry PI. The problem with that project type is that you will not be able to make use of the libraries or the SDK available for .NET yet. You can still build applications with this project type but you have to make use of REST API and using REST API is not as straight-forward as SDKs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After the project creation is successful, you need to add below dependencies which will let you connect to IoT Hub and have a device to cloud communication. Below are the NuGet packages you need to install.</p>

<p>This package will enable you to have a device to cloud communication.</p>

Install-Package BuildAzure.IoT.Adafruit.BME280
</pre>

<p>This package is the wrapper for the BME280 sensor.</p>

<pre class="brush: plain">
Install-Package Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Client
</pre>

<p>Add the below namespaces in the <code>Main.xaml.cs</code> file.</p>

<pre class="brush: csharp">
using Newtonsoft.Json;
using Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Client;
using BuildAzure.IoT.Adafruit.BME280;
</pre>

<p>Declare the variables.</p>

<pre class="brush: csharp">
private DeviceClient _deviceClient;
private BME280Sensor _sensor;
private string iotHubUri = "piiothub.azure-devices.net";
private string deviceKey = "Tj60asOk5ffVAT6a6SvZKMOqo8DYKSwWV7eQ2pLf0/k=";
</pre>

<p>The <code>iothuburi</code> is the URL for the IoT Hub created in the Azure portal or from the IoT dashboard. You can get the device key from the <code>Device Explorer</code> section in the IoT Hub. You can see how to get the <code>Key</code> from the <code>Device Explorer</code> from the below screen shot. I am using the <code>Primary Key</code> as a <code>devicekey</code> in my code.</p>

<p><img src="/images/azure-iot-device-explorer.png" alt="Azure IoT Hub Device Explorer" /></p>

<p>In the constructor, initialize the <code>DeviceClient</code> and <code>BME280Sensor</code> objects. I have commented out the <code>InitializeComponent()</code>, but if you want you can keep it as it is.</p>

<pre class="brush: csharp">
public MainPage()
{
    //this.InitializeComponent();
    deviceClient = DeviceClient.Create(iotHubUri, new DeviceAuthenticationWithRegistrySymmetricKey("raspberrypi", deviceKey), TransportType.Mqtt);
    _sensor = new BME280Sensor();
    DeviceToCloudMessage();
}
</pre>

<p>Now add a function named <code>DeviceToCloudMessage</code> which will connect to the IoT Hub using the device key, read the sensor data, serialize the data in JSON format and send it to the IoT Hub. Add this at the very bottom of the constructor.</p>

<pre class="brush: csharp">
private async void DeviceToCloudMessage()
{
    await _sensor.Initialize();
    float temperature = 0.00f;
    float humidity = 0.00f;
    while (true)
    {
        temperature = await _sensor.ReadTemperature();
        humidity = await _sensor.ReadHumidity();
        var sensorData = new
        {
            date = String.Format("{0}, {1}, {2}",
                                 DateTime.Now.ToLocalTime().TimeOfDay.Hours,
                                 DateTime.Now.ToLocalTime().TimeOfDay.Minutes,
                                 DateTime.Now.ToLocalTime().TimeOfDay.Seconds),
            temp = Math.Round(temperature, 2),
            humid = Math.Round(humidity, 2)
        };
        var messageString = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(sensorData);
        var message = new Message(Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(messageString));
        await deviceClient.SendEventAsync(message);
        //Debug.WriteLine("{0} &gt; Sending message: {1}", DateTime.Now, messageString);
        Task.Delay(5000).Wait();
    }
}
</pre>

<p>The <code>date</code> property in the <code>sensorData</code> type is being set in this specific way because we want to see the graph continuously moving. I can also read <code>Pressure</code> from the sensor but as I am not interested in showing this data, I am skipping it out. If you want you can use it but you also have to change the web app to show this reading. Before I can send this data to the IoT Hub, I am serializing the <code>sensorData</code> object and use ASCII encoding to get the <code>byte[]</code> and pass it to the <code>Message</code> class constructor. The last step is to send the message to the hub by using the <code>DeviceClient</code> class <code>SendEventAsync</code> method. In the last line I am adding a delay of 5 seconds between each reading. You can increase the time and see how the chart renders. I recommend not to go below this time delay as this might give you some false readings from the sensor.</p>

<p>I took this code from the documentation here and tweaked it to have the real data from the sensor connected to the device. Press Ctrl+Shift+B to build the solution. Navigate to <code>Project</code> and then click <code>&lt;project&gt; Properties</code>. Under <code>Debug</code> section, set the <code>Start Options</code> as shown below. Notice that the <code>Platform</code> is set to <code>ARM</code> and <code>Configuration</code> is <code>Active (Debug)</code>. When you are done with debugging the code and ready to deploy the code to the device you need to change it to <code>Release</code>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/iotweatherhub-properties.png" alt="IoT Weather App Properties" /></p>

<p>Unlike Raspbian, where we ssh or RDP into the device and compile or build the code, Windows 10 IoT works in a different way. You need to remote deploy the application from Visual Studio. Also, if you have enabled the remote debugging on the device, you also have to add the <code>port number</code> to the <code>Remote Machine</code> value and set the <code>Authentication Mode</code> to <code>None</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: When you make changes to device application, you also need to change/increment the version of the application in the Package.appxmanifest file. If you miss this step then the application deployment will fail.
<img src="/images/iot-app-packaging.png" alt="IoT App Packaging" /></p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="/images/windows10-iot-debug.png" alt="Windows 10 IoT Debug" /></p>

<p>To deploy the app to the device, click the <code>Build</code> menu and select <code>Deploy &lt;Project Name&gt;</code>. If you are deploying the application for the first time, it will take some time to get deployed. After the deployment is successful, you will see the application under the <code>App</code> section. At this moment, the application is stopped. To start the application in the, click the <code>Play</code> button in the list to start the application. The <code>App Type</code> show the type of application or you can say the mode it is running on. When I created the application, I selected the <code>UWP</code> application and therefore, it will always run in the <code>Foreground</code> type. The reason I choose this application type (UWP) is because I can then use the SDK to communicate with the IoT Hub. If you want to create a <code>Background</code> application type then you can download this Visual Studio Extension for 2017 and <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MicrosoftIoT.WindowsIoTCoreProjectTemplates">this</a> for Visual Studio 2015 which will let you build the background application. Keep in mind that you cannot use any SDK library with this project type. All you have now is the power of REST API which is not very easy to use.</p>

<h4 id="setting-the-web-app">Setting the Web App</h4>

<p>You can build any kind of app to visualize the data, but because the SDK support for .NET is good I am going to set up a simple MVC application using .NET Framework. As of now, you cannot use Azure SDK with .NET Core application and also it looks like the team does not have any plans to shift their focus for releasing the SDK for .NET Core anytime soon.</p>

<p>Start with installing NuGet packages. First with the package that will let you read the data from the Queue.</p>

<pre class="brush: plain">
Install-Package WindowsAzure.ServiceBus
</pre>

<p>Because this is a real-time application you also need to install SignalR</p>

<pre class="brush: plain">
Install-Package Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR
</pre>

<p>After these packages are installed, You need a way to visualize the temperature and humidity received from the queue. To do this you can use any jquery chart plugin or any other library of your choice. I will be using <a href="https://developers.google.com/chart">Google Charts</a> in my app, <a href="https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/linechart">Line Charts</a> to be precise. Installation is straight forward for the charts and you can play around with different options to tweak the look and feel of the chart. I am going to add the chart code in the <code>Index.cshtml</code> file. Below is the complete code for the chart to render.</p>

<pre class="brush: javascript">
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="https://www.gstatic.com/charts/loader.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;div id="chart_div"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
    var data = [];
    var chart;
    google.charts.load('current', { packages: ['corechart', 'line'] });
    google.charts.setOnLoadCallback(loadChart);
    var hub = $.connection.ioTHub;
    $.connection.hub.start();
    hub.client.iotHubNotification = function (d) {
        console.log(d);
        var pi = JSON.parse(d);
        var time = pi.date.split(',');
        var temp = pi.temp;
        var humid = pi.humid;
        data.addRows([[[parseInt(time[0]), parseInt(time[1]), parseInt(time[2])], temp, humid]]);
        var options = {
            height: 250,
            hAxis: {
                title: 'Time'
            },
            vAxis: {
                title: 'Temperature / Humidity',
                gridlines: { count: 22 }
            }
        };
        chart.draw(data, options);
    };
    function loadChart() {
        data = new google.visualization.DataTable();
        data.addColumn('timeofday', 'Time');
        data.addColumn('number', 'Temperature');
        data.addColumn('number', 'Humidity');
        var options = {
            height: 250,
            hAxis: {
                title: 'Time'
            },
            vAxis: {
                title: 'Temperarture / Humidity',
                gridlines: { count: 22 }
            }
        };
        chart = new google.visualization.LineChart(document.getElementById('chart_div'));
        chart.draw(data, options);
    }
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<p>I make use of the sample code from the examples at Google Charts and used it along with some minor tweaks to suite my needs. <code>loadChart()</code> function is called for the first time when the page is loaded and then I have a SignalR hub which updates the chart with the same option sets that I have in the <code>loadChart()</code> function. I add 3 data columns to display the data in the chart. There are few things that I would like to talk about in the above code. First is the <code>timeofday</code> is displayed on a <code>X-Axis</code> because time is continuous and I want to update the chart with time. Second, the <code>gridlines</code> property of the <code>vAxis</code> let you set how many horizontal rows you want to see in the graph. I have increased it to quite a significant number because I want to see the graph in more detail. You can play around with these settings and see what looks better for you. Third, the response I receive in the <code>hub</code> is in string format and therefore, I have parsed that string to JSON in order to read it and set to the rows. Also note that I have leave the <code>console.log</code> in the above code so that when you run the web app you can see the raw data in the console.</p>

<p>In the <code>HomeController.cs</code>, first I will set the connection string to the queue which I have associated with the IoT Hub endpoint in Azure and set the queue name along with the <code>IHubContext</code> for SignalR communication.</p>

<pre class="brush: csharp">
private string connectionString = "Endpoint=sb://iothubqueue-ns.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=RootManageSharedAccessKey;SharedAccessKey=88kJcD1mvJnO1jtiiY+AcUtIoinW//V/lF2WicOJ50s=";
private string queueName = "iothubqueue";
private IHubContext _hubContext;
</pre>

<p>In the constructor, initialize the <code>IHubContext</code> object.</p>

<pre class="brush: csharp">
_hubContext = GlobalHost.ConnectionManager.GetHubContext&lt;IoTHub&gt;();
</pre>

<p>Here is the code for the <code>IoTHub</code> class:</p>

<pre class="brush: csharp">
using Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR;
namespace IoTHubTempWebApp.Hubs
{
    public class IoTHub : Hub
    {
        public void IoTHubNotification(string value)
        {
            Clients.All.iotHubNotification(value);
        }
    }
}
</pre>

<p>And the code for <code>Startup</code> class <code>(Startup.cs)</code></p>

<pre class="brush: csharp">
using Microsoft.Owin;
using Owin;
[assembly: OwinStartup(typeof(IoTHubTempWebApp.Startup))]
namespace IoTHubTempWebApp
{
    public class Startup
    {
        public void Configuration(IAppBuilder app)
        {
            app.MapSignalR();
        }
    }
}
</pre>

<p>In the Index <code>ActionResult</code>, I will start a task which will read the messages from the queue and then SignalR will broadcast it to the client side which in turn update the chart with the latest data or temperature/humidity readings.</p>

<pre class="brush: csharp">
public ActionResult Index()
{
    Task task = Task.Run(() =&gt;
    {
        QueueClient client = QueueClient.CreateFromConnectionString(connectionString, queueName, ReceiveMode.ReceiveAndDelete);
        client.OnMessage(message =&gt;
        {
            Stream stream = message.GetBody&lt;Stream&gt;();
            StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(stream, Encoding.ASCII);
            string s = reader.ReadToEnd();
            _hubContext.Clients.All.ioTHubNotification(s);
        });
    });
    task.Wait();
    return View();
}
</pre>

<p>First I create a <code>QueueClient</code> object with the connection string and queue name along with the <code>ReceiveMode</code>. I have set <code>ReceiveMode</code> to <code>ReceiveAndDelete</code> as I want to delete the data from the queue once it has been read. Though you have an option to have the data in the queue for the maximum of 7 days in Azure. The <code>QueueClient</code> has an <code>OnMessage</code> event which process a message in an event-driven message pump, which means that as soon as the something is being added to the queue, this event is fired. I get the message body in the form of <code>Stream</code>, read the message to the end and pass the message to SignalR hub which in turn updates my chart in real-time. Here is the final output I have now.</p>

<p><img src="/images/iot-weatherhub-ui.png" alt="IoT Weather App in action" /></p>

<p>If you look closely, you will notice that the temperature line is not as smooth as you thought it would be. This is because every time when Raspberry PI read the data from the sensor there is a slight change in the temperature only with a few decimal places. If you don&rsquo;t like this then you can change the <code>gridlines</code> property of the <code>vAxis</code> in the chart. Also you can try changing the time delay on the device to see if that impacts the lines on the chart. try changing both time delay in the device application and the <code>gridlines</code> in the web application to see how the chart renders.</p>

    <p>Mostly all web applications out there has some way or the other amazing ways to upload a single or multiple files. While surfing on Github I found <a href="http://www.dropzonejs.com/">this amazing library</a> to upload the files to the server in a unique way with lot of configurations. It support parallel uploads along with cancellation of the files which are in the upload queue along with a good looking progress bar to show the progress of upload.</p>

<p>I get the drag and drop to work in just like 5 minutes. It is super easy and that with some powerful configurations. To install Dropzone you can use the Nuget command.</p>

<pre class="brush: plain">
PM> Install-Package dropzone
</pre>

<p>Add reference of js and css files on your page. To get the UI ready use this HTML.</p>

<pre class="brush: html">
&lt;div class="row"&gt;
    &lt;div class="col-md-9"&gt;
        &lt;div id="dropzone"&gt;
            &lt;form action="/Home/Upload" class="dropzone needsclick dz-clickable" id="uploader"&gt;
                &lt;div class="dz-message needsclick"&gt;
                    Drop files here or click to upload.&lt;br&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/form&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

<p>The output of the above HTML looks like this.</p>

<p><img src="/images/dropzonejs-output.png" alt="Dropzone output in HTML" /></p>

<p>There are few points to be noted here in the above HTML. Notice the <code>action</code> and <code>class</code> attributes for the <code>form</code> element. You will also be needing the <code>id</code> attribute as well. Here the <code>action</code> attribute points to the <code>ActionResult</code> which is responsible to handle the file upload. I have pointed it to the <code>Upload</code> ActionResult in my controller class which accepts a parameter of type <a href="https://docs.asp.net/projects/api/en/latest/autoapi/Microsoft/AspNetCore/Http/IFormFile/">IFormFile</a>. In case of a MVC application, we would have used <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.httppostedfilebase(v=vs.110).aspx">HttpPostedFileBase</a> class. Here is the complete code which handles the file upload.</p>

<pre class="brush: csharp">
[HttpPost]
public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; Upload(IFormFile file)
{
    var uploads = Path.Combine(_environment.WebRootPath, "uploads");
    if (file.Length &gt; 0)
    {
        using (var fileStream = new FileStream(Path.Combine(uploads, file.FileName), FileMode.Create))
        {
            await file.CopyToAsync(fileStream);
        }
    }
    return RedirectToAction("Index");
}
</pre>

<p>The <code>_environment</code> variable you see in the above code is the instance of <code>IHostingEnvironment</code> interface which I have injected in the controller. Always use <code>IHostingEnvironment</code> interface to resolve the paths. You can hard code the file path but it may not work on other platforms. The combine method returns the correct path based on the platform the code is executing. The <code>WebRootPath</code> property returns the path of <code>wwwroot</code> folder and the second parameter <code>uploads</code> is then appended correctly with the path.</p>

<p>Now it is time to make some adjustment in the Dropzone configuration. Recall the <code>id</code> attribute of the <code>form</code> element. I named it uploader. The Dropzone library has a unique way to set the configuration. Like this.</p>

<pre class="brush: javascript">
&lt;script&gt;
    $(document).ready(function () {
        Dropzone.options.uploader = {
            paramName: "file",
            maxFilesize: 2,
            accept: function (file, done) {
                if (file.name == "test.jpg") {
                    alert("Can't upload a test file.");
                }
                else {
                    //Show a confirm alert and display the image on the page.
              }
           }
        };
});
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<p>You have to be a bit careful when setting this configuration. In the configuration above the <code>paramName</code> states the name that will be used to transfer the file. This name should be the same as the <code>IFormFile</code> parameter of the <code>Upload</code> method in the controller. In this case I am using <code>file</code> and the same has to be there in the param of the <code>Upload</code> method. If the names mis-match the files will not be uploaded. The other parameter I am using is the <code>maxFileSize</code> and is very much self-explanatory. I have set the size to be <code>2 MB</code> and because of this configuration, any file above this limit will not be uploaded. Here is an example of such kind of failure.</p>

<p><img src="/images/file-upload-dragndrop.png" alt="Dropzone drag and drop upload" /></p>

<p>All the other files were uploaded successfully except one file which is <code>4.32 MB</code> and is way beyond the limit I set in my Dropzone configuration. If you hover the file, you will see why it got failed.</p>

<p><img src="/images/file-upload-error.png" alt="Upload file error" /></p>

<p>This is the simplest approach through which you can have drag and drop upload support in your applications. The configuration I am using here is the simplest and minimalistic configuration that can get you started in no time. There are some more powerful configurations like <a href="http://www.dropzonejs.com/#config-parallelUploads">parallelUploads</a> and <a href="http://www.dropzonejs.com/#config-uploadMultiple">uploadMultiple</a> that you should look into and use it.</p>

    <p>I run a custom blog engine I wrote myself on MVC 4 and as you would have thought it is on Windows hosting. I am re-writing my blog engine in .NET Core so that I can get it running on a Linux hosting as well. I am using Windows machine and Visual Studio Community Edition to write it and using a Ubuntu VM box to test it. My current blog uses SQL Server as a back-end but Linux does not support SQL Server and therefore I have to move to MySQL or any other No-SQL database available for Linux distros. For now I will be saving everything on the disk in JSON format.</p>

<p>The problem comes when I switch from database to file system. Both Windows and Linux file systems are different, so when working I hard-coded the data folder which holds all the posts for my blog. I publish the solution and deploy it to Ubuntu VM. I started the server and it ended up showing me this error in the console.</p>

<p><img src="/images/dotnet-prod.png" alt="Dotnet production command" /></p>

<p>Notice the path of the data folder in the above screenshot. The path I am referring in the code ends up with backward slash which is not a UNIX format. Also a thing to note here is that UNIX follows a strict naming convention unlike Windows. For example, in Windows Data and data are same, but in UNIX they are not. Because I have hard-coded the path in my application while developing, it will end up in an error on UNIX machine.</p>

<p>To make the paths consistent in your application, I have to make use of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/api/system.io">System.IO</a> namespace <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/api/system.io.path">Path</a> class&rsquo;s <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/api/system.io.path#System_IO_Path_Combine_System_String_System_String_">Combine</a> method. <code>Combine</code> method is an overloaded method. If you are hearing this method for the first time then make sure you read the documentation. This method renders the correct path based on the platform my code is executing. So instead of doing something like this.</p>

<pre class="brush: csharp">
var _posts = Directory.EnumerateFiles("Data\\Posts");
</pre>

<p>I have done something like this.</p>

<pre class="brush: csharp">
string posts = Path.Combine("Data", "Posts");
_files = Directory.EnumerateFiles(posts);
</pre>

<p>In short, if you are developing a .NET Core application targeting Windows along with UNIX and OSX, then make sure that you follow this approach to get the correct paths or else you will end up with an exception and your website inaccessible.</p>
