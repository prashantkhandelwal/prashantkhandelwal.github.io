      <description>My team at Microsoft is responsible for building tools that enhance customer experience when you contact Microsoft support. Although our tools are never used by customers directly but they play an essential role in improving the experience and overall cost reductions. This means that our work is critical for the overall success and it should perform under variance of load, especially on holidays.
Problem Statement Team wants to test their application from different geographies and mark the metrics used.</description>

      <description>Terraform is my go-to IAC tool for building my infrastructure in Azure. I usually use Azure DevOps pipeline to execute my terraform plan, but it would be nice to know if I can execute it programmatically or on request basis. Even on request basis you can trigger a CI/CD pipeline to provision the infrastructure but maybe it is too much for a simple project to have.
One of the biggest pain points has been the authentication in command line tooling.</description>

      <description>Docker Hub or GitHub Container Registry also known as ghcr.io is a go to platform for most of the OSS developers and teams to host their Docker images. These platforms are free for open-source software, but you might need to upgrade from the free plan to use a paid plan so that your docker image is only available for your infrastructure use and not for public use.
Azure provides Container Registry service where you can host your Docker images with ease and use the same docker pull and run command to pull and run the container on your machine, or you can also use these images to create containers when provisioning a new Web App which uses containers or with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).</description>

      <description>In the past decade Marvel has gathered a lot of fans following which eventually led all the fans to know more about how the Marvel comics universe characters, stories, events are mapped or linked to each other.
In 2017 (if I am remembering it correctly), at Microsoft Build event, Microsoft announces Bot framework and did a demo with CosmosDB graph database which uses Gremlin query from Apache TinkerPop. It was a great demo, and I was really impressed by how they did it but unfortunately, I was unable to find the source code for that demo anywhere.</description>

      <description>If you have ever got your hands on Azure Function or on AWS Lambda, then you might be familiar with the concept of serverless computing. So in order to test the concept of a function (serverless function), we have to have an Azure or an AWS account. The SDK from both the platforms allow you to build, develop and test the functions on your local development machine, but when it comes to production environment, you again have to turn yourself to Azure or AWS for hosting it.</description>

      <description>Draw.IO is a great alternative for Microsoft Visio. It allows me to quickly draw flowcharts and diagrams. I have been using this for a long time and the best part is that Draw.IO is open source on Github with web and offline (desktop) version. I personally use desktop version but what if I would like to host it in my own org or would like to work with the web instance instead of the desktop version.</description>

      <description>Visual Studio has made integrating of Azure Active Directory authentication in web applications very simple. If you are creating the application and want to integrate the AD authentication then it is a pretty easy task given that you have an Active Directory in Azure. But what if you have an application and it is out there running and now you want to change the authentication medium of your application so you can have better control and security of your web application.</description>

I am re-writing my blog engine in .NET Core so that I can get it running on a Linux hosting as well. I am using Windows machine and Visual Studio Community Edition to write it and using a Ubuntu VM box to test it. My current blog uses SQL Server as a back-end but Linux does not support SQL Server and therefore I have to move to MySQL or any other No-SQL database available for Linux distros.</description>

      <description>Setting up the new Angular 2 app with Web API and .NET core is easy but can be a bit tricky. The older beta releases of Angular 2 works fine as there are not many files to refer and to work with. When I started using Angular 2 it was in RC1 and the way the files are being referenced in the app is bit different than the older versions of Angular 2.</description>

      <description>Previous versions of MVC allows us to write HtmlHelpers which does a pretty good job then and they are doing it now as well. But in MVC 6, the ASP.NET team has introduced TagHelpers.
Parsing Markdown in .NET is way too simple than one can imagine. Thanks to Stackoverflow&amp;rsquo;s MarkdownSharp and Karlis Gangis&amp;rsquo;s CommonMark.NET. I use CommonMark.NET as it provides a much faster parsing than other libraries. The blogging platform I use is a custom blogging engine I wrote in MVC4.</description>

For a person like me who has no knowledge of electronics and C/C++, this was a gift. Now here I am using Raspberry PI&amp;rsquo;s latest version and I have everything I ever wanted on a single piece of hardware.
To get started with Python and Raspberry PI, I looked into the &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo; sort of LED blinking example.</description>

I tried to install ASP.NET VNext on Ubuntu VM in which I terribly failed in the first go. Why? because the tutorial I used was quite old and I messed up the installation of pre-requisites.</description>

But it is not always the case, things will not always work as you want it to be. Here is the case of what I was trying to do.</description>

      <description>This is open-source at its best. Running background task to work in context with ASP.NET was and is still a big deal for few developers. I user QueueUserWorkItem to schedule emails when a new comment is added on my blog. This makes sure that the UI is responsive and the user can close or navigate to other post. I have been working on enterprise applications for many years now and most of the long running tasks are running in the background i.</description>

      <description>Building real-time applications with SignalR is easy. But building real-time applications with JavaScript will be a problem if you are not aware of Firebase. I first heard of it when I was learning AngularJS. The official AngularJS site has the example where you can add, edit and delete the detials in real-time. This example uses Firebase as the storage and updates the UI in real time.
The data is stored in JSON format and accessing it using jQuery makes it very easy.</description>

      <description>Working with Google Drive API is fun. The documentation is good and will let you get started with the API pretty quickly. I have my whole complete family album on OneDrive, but the API is still a bit hard to use as compared to Google Drive API or maybe it is just for me. But while playing around with Drive API I ended up creating a small razor based web page application which will allow you to show your folder as an online web album.</description>

      <description>While working with a small web based project many developers will take advantage of web.config and XML files to read settings for the application. Using web.config is a good way but you cannot change the settings from within the application and when done manually it causes the website to restart. XML is good but many of us has a problem when it comes to update the details in XML. Biggy is an awesome library developed by Rob Conery to work with document storage.</description>

      <description>I like Wordpress but not as much as I like BlogEngine.NET. I have to move to Wordpress because of a very serious issue in BlogEngine.NET. I am on a shared hosting and they are very peculiar about the memory/CPU usage of a site. So, The problem I faced was that if I use SQL Server CE as your data store than it will increase the disk usage time which in turn shuts down my site application pool and cause 503 service unavailable error.</description>

      <description>If you are using Google chat on your browser you can see a notification pop-up when a new chat message arrives. I don’t use Google chat or GTalk a lot for communication so I am not very well versed about its over all functionality and coolness. But one thing that always got my attention in the past was the notification that I get on my desktop from Google. This is a very cool feature and my colleagues find it a very important feature of chat as it get their attention immediately.</description>

      <description>There are many syntax highlighting plugins available on the web right now. Majority of the sites are using javascript based Syntax Highlighter from Alex Gorbatchev. I am using it for my current blog and BlogEngine.NET has it as a default syntax highlighter. It is good because it has a lot of themes to offer and you can also customize according to the look and feel of your blog or site.</description>

      <description>When I heard about Glimpse, I thought it like to be another MiniProfiler like stuff or a combination of MiniProfiler and this. But it seems to be more robust diagnostic tool for developers. Here is my experience with this awesome diagnostic tool.
What is Glimpse? Glimpse is a diagnostic tool for ASP.NET applications which let you see detailed diagnostic information of your web application. Glimpse knows everything your server is doing and displays it straight away to you in your browser.</description>

There is no point of saving me a bookmark if I can’t share out with other developers (this is my thought on bookmarks). Therefore, from today onward I’ll be doing a blog post week or may be monthly to share by bookmark with the rest of you guys and moreover I have a huge collection of funny programmer pics which also accompany my bookmarks.</description>

      <description>I was exploring Github for some image effects/filters and I found some but still keep exploring and found an interesting plugin called face-detection. This plugin uses HTML5 getUserMedia to use your web camera only if your browser supports it. Unfortunately, IE10 still doesn’t support it. This seems cool to me, so I created a sample application to test it. This sample application will let you preview the video using your web camera and allows you to capture the image from your web camera and upload it to the Azure storage.</description>

      <description>I used to have BlogEngine.NET as my blogging platform before switching to WordPress, and that is because of my poor hosting provider who can’t afford few MBs on the shared hosting plans. I like BlogEngine.NET a lot because it is in .NET and on the other hand WordPress is on PHP which I don’t know. BlogEngine.NET is still evolving and is getting better with every release. BlogEngine.NET supports multiple databases like SQL Server, SQL Server CE, MySQL, XML file, VistaDB and may be few more.</description>

It will not be an easy task but I will be going to learn a lot of things. As I was planning things ahead I came across a problem where I have to load my blog stats like FeedBurner readers, Facebook page likes, Google +1 count, twitter followers inside a div on the page.</description>

      <description>I have created a wrapper class to simplify my work with REST API. I assume that you will be using a web application. First step is to create an application at dev.live.com. Once the application is created you will have the ClientID, Client Secret and Redirect domain. We will be using a ClientID and Redirect domain. Remember that the Redirect domain value cannot have localhost. You must provide a correct domain name as after successful authentication you, the user will be redirected to the domain along with the access token.</description>

We do have many options like Git, TFS Express or VSS or may be another source control software.</description>

How many times you have been yelling when you paste the code from a blog post or from an article which eventually turns out to be a nightmare for you to re-format it? I came across a VS extension that can actually get this done for me. The good thing about this extension is that it is open-source and you can extend and contribute to it to make it more awesome.</description>

Why one has to invest in a service that can be available with no cost at all? Though some services are good enough to pay for, but I suggest one should not get them unless you really need one.
I have been blogging and in a job for now almost 4 years and as a programmer I am a really big fan of open-source projects which have made my/our life easy without spending a single dime.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, while working on a project I came across a weird problem while working with Colorbox jquery plugin and ASP.NET. The problem is not only with Colorbox but also with another famous plugin called Fancybox. If you plan to use the plugine just to show dialog boxes, then this plugin works perfectly fine. Integrating the plugin with ASP.NET works fine but prevents post back if you have server controls on the colorbox dialog box (which is actually an invisible div on the page).</description>

      <description>I have an account with Appharbor but never tried to deploy an application. Appharbor has an excellent integration with Github and Codeplex and if you are planning to showcase you application latest build then Appharbor is the best thing to do that. The Appharbor site has a detailed tutorial on how you can deploy your application from Github and Codeplex. But the question here is what will a programmer do if he just wants to deploy the application from his dektop or in other words if he wants to test his application which is not an open source application.</description>

The application I built is a simple web application which will allow you to enter artist name and the song name and let you search the lyrics, album art, artist image, album name and album release date.</description>

      <description>I love working with MVC but I do have a hard time working with complex data with EntityFramework (EF). I heard of using inline SQL queries in MVC but don&amp;rsquo;t know how to use it and will it have any performance issues? Few month&amp;rsquo;s back I downloaded the StackOverflow (SO) Data Explorer which is an open-source project built on MVC to explore data dump provided by SO. The thing that took my attention in that code was that they have been SQL queries to get the data from the database.</description>

      <description>I didn&amp;rsquo;t create the whole solution by myself. The initial idea is from the All-In-One Code Framework sample. I was just customizing my BlogEngine and for one of the module I thought it would be nice not to use paging and I should go for infinite scrolling stuff. This idea seems cool to me and without wasting any time I just do a quick web search and I came across a solution which is a part of a All-In-One Code Framework.</description>

      <description>No one likes if their favourite site is loading up slow. Using CSS sprites instead of using individual images and minify javascript and css files is a way to minimize the request send to the server and also saves you few KBs or may be even MBs. If your site is high on using javacript and CSS then you should minimize them.
I recently used SquishIt to combine/minimize my CSS and javascript files.</description>

 In Visual Studio 2010, we have partnered with Flexera, makers of InstallShield, to create InstallShield Limited Edition 2010 just for Visual Studio 2010 customers. The InstallShield Limited Edition 2010 offers comparable functionality to the Visual Studio Installer projects. In addition, you can build your deployment projects using Team Foundation Server and MSBuild.</description>

As a curious reader, I downloaded the sample files and took a look and also get it running on my LINUX VM. It worked like a charm. But I am a Windows user and .NET programmer, the question is how can I do the same in ASP.NET?
So, to get myself started I used the same downloaded files that I used to check the PHP version of the file drag and drop.</description>

Use the HTML5 badge builder to create a badge and use it on your blog/website to show your support. The badge builder allows you to customize the badge with tech you use with HTML5. You can see the badge I customized with the tech under badge section on the right.

Last.fm has a powerful API but they don&amp;rsquo;t provide any API call to fetch lyrics. The two most popular APIs on the web that I am aware of is WikiLyrics, LyricsDB (popularly known as LyrDB), there is another API from ChartLyrics but I don&amp;rsquo;t find it as useful as the other two APIs.</description>

To get started add the two javascript files, one is the jquery file and the other one is the plugin file.</description>

I am using JQuery to handle the text changed event but eventually the text changed event doesn&amp;rsquo;t seems to be working in MVC as it is working for a text box changed event in web forms. The solution I found seems to be working fine for me as I don&amp;rsquo;t want to fire an event on every key press.</description>

private static string[] RemoveDuplicates(ArrayList arrList) { HashSet&amp;lt;string Hset = new HashSet&amp;lt;string((string[])arrList.ToArray(typeof(string))); string[] Result = new string[Hset.Count]; Hset.CopyTo(Result); return Result; }   Note: I found this method on the net and therefore I am sharing it as it is.</description>

      <description>Finally, I got to know the way to show Google Analytics stats on my blog space. To know more about using Google Analytics API read their official article on using the API.
I have built a widget with the help of Analytics API to show the Google Analytics stats on my blog. The widget shows three stats at the moment (I don&amp;rsquo;t want to make the widget look complex). Below is a screenshot for the widget in action on my blog:</description>

      <description>I have now been using BlogEngine for 2 years now and I was kinda fed up with the standard theme I have been since starting which I have modified a bit to look more prettier. I am not saying it&amp;rsquo;s bad but it&amp;rsquo;s too much now, I should do a makeover of my blog. Now the BlogEngine community is not as big and vast as that of the most popular blogging engine Wordpress and therefore it is hard to get beautiful themes for BlogEngine.</description>

      <description>If you have long URLs and other and want to create short URLs then Bit.ly API can help. I wrote a wrapper class which can let me create short URLs in jiffy. I was working on Bit.ly API to create my short URLs with a click of a button (that&amp;rsquo;s for my personal use). Therefore, I ended up with a &amp;lsquo;short&amp;rsquo; class to create short URLs using Bit.ly API. What you need is a login and an apikey, which you can have one for yourself by signing up for a free account.</description>

      <description>A Few months back I wrote a post on how to use jQuery plugin Uploadify to upload single/multiple files without postback in ASP.NET. The program works similarly to simple file upload sites in its ease of use. Now a few days back I was working on a demo project which is on MVC 3 Razor and I use the same plugin without any problems. But the files that are being uploaded are uploaded to the root folder instead of the folder I specified to upload the files.</description>

The best things I found in the new RAZOR view engine is the code is pretty much tidy no traditional code behinds and moreover you can work with the server-side code with the start of the @ symbol.</description>

WPF makes Jumplists more simpler. You need not to add any API reference or any other reference in your project. You can just make the use of Jumplists for better navigation for your users.</description>

      <description>I am now using Windows 7 since its beta release and so far my experience is awesome. But as a developer the hard drive space is always been a problem for me, no matter how many external drives or other stoarge devices you have connected to your machine but the disk space on the host machine is always a primary problem. Windows 7 is more stable OS in Windows family so far (I found it more stable than Win XP) and the reason it is being more stable because everytime you install a program on your Win 7 machine, it automatically creates a snapshot of the host drive.</description>

      <description>To locate a place on maps (Bing or Google), the best thing is to get the latitude and longitude of the location, this ensures that the place we are pinning on the map is accurate. But the big question is to where to get the latitude and longitude of the location. There might be a web service for getting the latitude and longitude of a location, but wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be nice if you just have to query a local database?</description>

But some notorious users create short URLs for the spam sites which doesn&amp;rsquo;t make any sense to us. As you know by looking at the short URLs, they won&amp;rsquo;t reveal anything. But there is a way to get the original/long URL through ASP.</description>

The best part of this code snippet is that it just don&amp;rsquo;t uses the excel interop, so you need not to worry about the Office version or PIAs installed at user&amp;rsquo;s machine. What actualy is needed is just a Reflection namespace - System.Reflection and it will bind the data to the instance of the excel application.</description>

The Windows 7 API Code Pack comes with many other features which can be used while developing applications for Windows 7 platform. The Windows 7 API Code Pack comes with some sample applications which exposes the power of the API.
In one of my previous projects I used the Task Dialog class to use some cool looking message boxes like the one we see in Windows 7.</description>

You can set the height and width of the CAPTCHA image while initializing the CAPTCHA class. The CAPTCHA image generated from the class can be set to the image control directly or it can be save to the local path and then set to the image control.</description>

So let&amp;rsquo;s begin up getting files under one hood.
Use the below live links for jQuery auto-complete and CSS.

He wanted this for his application which requires registration first before a user can start using his application.
I don&amp;rsquo;t know the answer so I bing arond a bit and find a solution posted by someone though I don&amp;rsquo;t have the name but it worked like a charm&amp;hellip;.</description>

Some of the reader requested me that it would be better if I could show how you can implement membership and roles with OpenID authentication. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t seems easy in the first place, because you will require a bit more informaton from the user like his name and e-mail address. So, what I am trying to show you here is how you can gather information of the user who has logged in with OpenID and then you can use that information to set roles and membership for your website.</description>

      <description>If you are using JQuery controls like date picker, accordion, progress bar, slider, tabs, dialog etc. You can set the theme of your choice or you can also allow the user to set the theme of their choice. For those folks who don’t know about the JQuery Theme Roller, then take a look at official Jquery site demonstrating the Jquery Theme Roller. The best part is when you select the theme from the theme roller control all the JQuery controls on the page will automatically inherit the color scheme of the theme.</description>

      <description>URL Routing was first introduced in .NET framework 3.5 SP1 but MVC has built-in and works pretty decently to create SEO friendly URL and prevents URL hacking. ASP.NET 4.0 is now introduced with a new feature called URL routing with web forms. URL routing help developers to create short and friendly URLs which enhance search engine page ranking. There are few other ways to create short friendly URLs like URLrewriter.net extension or if you have a physical access to IIS you can have installed URL Rewriter extension for IIS 7 to create short friendly URLs.</description>

      <description>If you think that Silverlight applications are only intended to be run on web browsers, then you are wrong! Silverlight is now widely used to build Rich Internet Application (RIA) allowing users to work more efficiently and make a working session more interactive and attractive. As we all know a customer will always seek for a short-cut method, he will never listen to your comments or suggestions and wants everything to be done in few mouse clicks.</description>

So I drop an e-mail to Scott Hanselman and was waiting for his response. If you look at Scott’s blog you will see that he has very simple URL for his blog posts which eventually get his posts higher ranks on search engine indexing.</description>

      <description>Recently I was reading an article on some Windows 7 forums on how to change Windows Logon Background. There are manual steps which helps me to change the longon background, but its tedious if I have to do it manually everytime. So I decided to make a tool which can do it for me.
I start up a new project in Visual Studio 2010 and create a new windows application. I am not writing about how I did it, I am just giving away this tool for use.</description>

      <description>We all know about a feature called User Account Control (UAC) which introduced with the launch of Windows Vista. By default, UAC is enabled and provides users a better and safer computing experience, but most of the users find it irritating when the UAC prompts everytime they try to run a program. Disabling UAC is not recommended at all.
With UAC enabled programmers find it difficult to access some of the locations on the local drive.</description>

      <description>The easiest way to find out the processor architecture is to use the Environment class GetEnvironmentVariable method.
Console.WriteLine(Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(&#34;PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE&#34;));  This will print the processor architecture on the console window i.e. x86 and x64 for 32-bit and 64-bit respectively.</description>

 Using SP_OACREATE with MSXML Create an assembly using SQL CLR using C#.  I personally tried using the first way to call a web service but was not successful.</description>

Why I am doing this? To navigate and get access to the application and internet addresses I need anytime. I am tired of typing addresses and navigating to the programs I frequently use. I have just started so I thought I must blog about my jump list experience with you all.</description>

So I give it a go and jump to Visual Studio options and start playing around with the option available to change the look and feel of the code editor. After trying for a while and working around with some customizations, I gave a second go and do a quick bing search in a hope that I will find some theme for my Visual Studio and Voila!</description>

      <description>Jquery is now one of the most favorite JavaScript frameworks to play around. It offers some more advance feature to the developers and UI designers to accomplish their task easily and more conveniently. Take an example of AJAX and think where you can face the problems when you have to deal with different browsers who support XMLHTTP request and the one who don’t. I remember, I use to initialize the AJAX’s XMLHTTP object keeping in mind what will be my client’s browser.</description>

      <description>Reporting is an important part for every application. Crystal reports are widely used and also available in Visual Studio for reporting purposes. I personally never like designing application interfaces and working on web designs, it needs good designing skills which I lack and so I never put my hands on designing anything, but sometimes we have to. In crystal reports when you create a report using wizard or just adding a blank report to the project and then fetching data using code (after designing), the report works fine on the machine where you have designed and develop it and the problem occurs when you have to deploy or distribute your application with reports on multiple machines or clients.</description>

      <description>Performance of SQL server matters while working with large enterprise applications and where performance really bothers the business workflow. When NOCOUNT is ON, the count of rows by the execution of the query (T-SQL statements) is not returned. You must have noticed that when you perform operations by executing INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE or SELECT statements, the server returns the number of rows. The count of rows is necessary while debugging your queries, when you are done with debugging you can turn NOCOUNT ON.</description>

Take this as an example, when we develop application say preferably an MDI application, we have multiple child forms inside one parent form. On MDI parent form we would like to have menu strip and tab strip which in turn calls other forms which build the other parts of the application.</description>

So first start declaring the variables. The first declare the document variable and a XML document variable as Varchar(8000) or Varchar(MAX) - It&amp;rsquo;s a same thing</description>

The below code can further be modified and a developer can easily extend the functionality of his application to create a application which accepts DLLs as plug-ins. This concept is useful when different users have different requirements in a generalized application like in the case of famous photo editing program Photoshop from Adobe.</description>

Copy and paste the data in the excel sheet is the quickest possible solution I can see&amp;hellip;but what if you have to data through your code? Still there are many possible ways to accomplish this but how many lines of code you have to write to achieve this?</description>

      <description>Performance of an application matters a lot for a developer. None of the developer wants his application freezes or crashes. But what are measures a developer should takes to keep it all good going. When I used to develop application I saw whenever I try to perform some heavy or bulky task like uploading files, copying files from place to other and other DB related but heavy task which includes CPU as well as hard drive.</description>

Firstly to get it running we have to use the below namespaces:</description>

      <description>Sending e-mail through code is easy, but how do we get to know that an e-mail that we send is delivered and read by the intended recipient. When we send e-mail through code we can request a delivery notification and read receipt from the receiver, similar to the way we do in outlook. But the problem is not every mail server supports this kind of request from the code. We set a mail header while sending mail from code which is then processed by the mail server and the sender of the mail gets the intended response.</description>

      <description>Here I illustrate how to create and use hash table. Each element of hash table is a combination of Key/Value pair stored in a DictionaryEntry object. A value in a hash table can be null or contains no value but a key cannot be of null reference. Key in hash table work as an identifier for the value where you can search a hash table for a value with a specified key.</description>

 It is easier to change the specification to fit the program than vice versa.
 If a program is useful, it will have to be changed.
 If a program is useless, it will have to be documented.
 Only ten percent of the code in any given program will ever execute.
 Software expands to consume all available resources.</description>

      <description>Performing BULK operations with SQL can be useful when you are trying to insert any type of file. Don&amp;rsquo;t mess up with the complex code, just use a simple SQL query to insert any file type in SQL table.
To perform this operation first you need to have a column with datatype as varbinary(max). See below example:
Create a table with an ID and Data as columns with INT and VARBINARY(MAX) as their Datatypes respectively.</description>

      <description>GUID pronounced as goo&amp;rsquo;id - Globally unique identifier is a 128-bit integer that can be used to uniquely identify something. If you want to identify the large collection of data GUID is the best approach in my view. Also you can use the autoincremental integer to identify records, this is the basic approach programmer&amp;rsquo;s use.
GUID method can be found under the System namespace and it also provides some overloads. Here is how we can use the GUID overloads:</description>
